## Development

FREE6 is an Apache NetBeans Gradle project using JDA, Jedis, Jackson and Logback.
Used Java version is 11, but it should also be compatible with Java 8.

## Hosting

FREE6 requires a running Redis server. Run FREE6 using `java -jar <path_to_jar> <path_to_conf>`. You might have to `cd` into the JAR's directory.
The JAR can be found in `build/libs/FREE6.jar`. Make sure you have Java 11 installed. It is, however, recommended to start & build FREE6 yourself using Gradle & Apache NetBeans.
For an example conf file, see `/conf/example.conf`. Note that it is recommended to start Redis yourself and that you should take additional security measures.
